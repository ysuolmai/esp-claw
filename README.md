**ESP-Claw** is Espressif's **Chat Coding** AI agent framework for IoT devices. It defines device behavior through conversation and completes the full loop of sensing, decision-making, and execution locally on Espressif chips. Inspired by the OpenClaw concept and reimplemented in C, ESP-Claw is lightweight, intelligent, and continuously evolving. With just an ESP32-series chip that costs only a few dollars, you can experience what makes ESP-Claw so nimble.

</div>

## 🌟 Key Features

Traditional IoT usually stops at connectivity: devices can connect to the network, but they cannot think; they can execute commands, but they cannot make decisions. ESP-Claw brings the Agent Runtime down onto Espressif chips, turning them from passive executors into active decision-making centers.

## 📦 Quick Start

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/src/assets/images/claw-breadboard-photo.jpg" width="80%" alt="ESP-Claw on ESP32-S3 Breadboard" />
</div>

ESP-Claw now supports a wide range of development boards based on ESP32-S3, ESP32-P4, ESP32-C5, and ESP32-S31, including breadboards, M5Stack CoreS3, and many others. Supported boards in [`./application/edge_agent/boards/`](./application/edge_agent/boards/) can be flashed online directly: configuration and flashing are done entirely in the browser, with no need to compile firmware locally or install a development environment first.

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://esp-claw.com/en/flash/">
    <img src="./docs/static/flash-via-browser-button.svg" width="200" />
  </a>
</div>

You can also build ESP-Claw locally. Please refer to the [local build documentation](https://esp-claw.com/en/tutorial/) for board adaptation, building, and flashing. Boards not listed above, as well as chips like the ESP32-P4, can also be supported through local builds and flashing.

You can find practical examples in our [documentation](https://esp-claw.com/en/tutorial/).

### Supported Platforms

    <img alt="Supported Platforms" src="./docs/static/claw-providers-black.webp" width="90%" />
  </picture>
</div>

**LLM**: ESP-Claw now supports both OpenAI-style APIs and Anthropic-style APIs. It natively supports GPT models from OpenAI, Qwen models from Alibaba Cloud Bailian, Claude models from Anthropic, DeepSeek models from DeepSeek API, and also supports custom endpoints.

> [!TIP]
>
> ESP-Claw's self-programming capability depends on models with strong tool use and instruction-following ability. We recommend `gpt-5.4`, `qwen3.6-plus`, `claude4.6-sonnet`, `deepseek-v4-pro` or models with comparable capability.

**IM**: ESP-Claw supports Telegram, QQ, Feishu, and WeChat, and can be extended further.

## Development Plan

ESP-Claw is still under active development. Feel free to open an issue to report problems or request features. You can also share your ideas through our [online survey (in Chinese)](https://fcn5wbhnyubf.feishu.cn/share/base/form/shrcndYcjbGFY1ymttTSyYoGIPh).
